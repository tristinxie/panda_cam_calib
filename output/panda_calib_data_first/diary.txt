Starting Arm Calibration
Extracting Chessboards
[Warning: The checkerboard must be asymmetric: one side should be even, and the other should be odd. Otherwise, the orientation of the board may
be detected incorrectly.] 
Finding Camera Parameters
Using given camera intrinsics:
  150.0646         0  159.6433
         0  150.0349  121.2872
         0         0    1.0000

Running Optimization
[Warning: Average projection error found to be 19.0 pixels.
This large error is a strong indicator that something has gone wrong.
Check that the input paramters are correct and sufficient checkerboard images were correctly processed.
If the problem persists, try manually tuning the baseEst and gripEst parameters.
If it still will not work, email me a z.taylor@acfr.usyd.edu.au
